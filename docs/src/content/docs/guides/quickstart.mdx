## Project Setup

<Steps>

1. Create a project and initialize npm. You'll only need to do this once.

   ```bash
   mkdir my_project
   cd my_project
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Install the Agents SDK and Zod. The SDK uses Zod v4 for tool schemas and structured outputs.

   ```bash
   npm install @openai/agents zod
   ```

3. Set an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, follow [these instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart#create-and-export-an-api-key) to create an OpenAI API key.

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

   Alternatively you can call `setDefaultOpenAIKey('<api key>')` to set the key
   programmatically and use `setTracingExportApiKey('<api key>')` for tracing.
   See [the config guide](/openai-agents-js/guides/config) for more details.

</Steps>

## Create your first agent

Agents are defined with instructions and a name.

<Code lang="typescript" code={createAgentExample} title="Create an agent" />

## Run your first agent

You can use the `run` method to run your agent. You trigger a run by passing both the agent you
want to start on and the input you want to pass in.

This will return a result that contains the final output and any actions that were performed
during that run.

<Code lang="typescript" code={runAgentExample} title="Run an agent" />

For a second turn, you can either pass `result.history` back into `run()`, attach a
[session](/openai-agents-js/guides/sessions), or reuse OpenAI server-managed state with
`conversationId` / `previousResponseId`. The [running agents](/openai-agents-js/guides/running-agents)
guide compares these approaches.

## Give your agent tools

You can give an agent tools to use to look up information or perform actions.

<Code lang="typescript" code={agentWithToolsExample} title="Add a tool" />

## Add a few more agents

Additional agents can be defined similarly to break down problems into smaller parts and have your
agent be more focused on the task at hand. It also allows you to use different models for different
problems by defining the model on the agent.

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  code={additionalAgentsExample}
  title="Create specialist agents"
/>

## Define your handoffs

In order to orchestrate between multiple agents, you can define `handoffs` for an agent. This will
enable the agent to pass the conversation on to the next agent. This will happen automatically
during the course of a run.

<Code lang="typescript" code={defineHandoffsExample} title="Define handoffs" />

After your run you can see which agent generated the final response by looking at the `lastAgent`
property on the result.

## Run the agent orchestration

The runner handles executing individual agents, any handoffs, and any tool calls.

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  code={runOrchestrationExample}
  title="Run agent orchestration"
/>

## Putting it all together

Let's put it all together into one full example. Place this into your `index.js` file and run it.
If your app is already set up for TypeScript, you can use `index.ts` instead.

<Code lang="typescript" code={quickstartExample} title="Quickstart" />

## View your traces

The Agents SDK will automatically generate traces for you. This allows you to review how your agents
are operating, what tools they called or which agent they handed off to.

To review what happened during your agent run, navigate to the
[Trace viewer in the OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/traces).

## Next steps

Learn how to build more complex agentic flows:

- Learn about configuring [Agents](/openai-agents-js/guides/agents).
- Learn about [running agents](/openai-agents-js/guides/running-agents) and [sessions](/openai-agents-js/guides/sessions).
- Learn about [tools](/openai-agents-js/guides/tools), [guardrails](/openai-agents-js/guides/guardrails), and [models](/openai-agents-js/guides/models).
