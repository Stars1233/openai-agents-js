When you [run your agent](/openai-agents-js/guides/running-agents), you will either receive a:

- [`RunResult`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents/classes/runresult) if you call `run` without `stream: true`
- [`StreamedRunResult`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents/classes/streamedrunresult) if you call `run` with `stream: true`. For details on streaming, also check the [streaming guide](/openai-agents-js/guides/streaming).

## Which property should I use?

Most applications only need a few result properties:

| Property                    | Use it when you need...                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `finalOutput`               | The final answer to show the user.                                              |
| `history`                   | A full next-turn input array (`input + generated items`) for manual chat loops. |
| `output`                    | Only the model-output-shaped items generated in this run.                       |
| `newItems`                  | Rich run items with agent/tool metadata for logs, UIs, or audits.               |
| `lastAgent` / `activeAgent` | The agent that should usually handle the next turn.                             |
| `lastResponseId`            | Continuation with `previousResponseId` on the next OpenAI Responses turn.       |
| `interruptions`             | Pending tool approvals you must resolve before resuming.                        |
| `state`                     | A serializable snapshot for resume/retry flows.                                 |

## Final output

The `finalOutput` property contains the final output of the last agent that ran. This result is either:

- `string` — default for any agent that has no `outputType` defined
- `unknown` — if the agent has a JSON schema defined as output type. In this case the JSON was parsed but you still have to verify its type manually.
- `z.infer<outputType>` — if the agent has a Zod schema defined as output type. The output will automatically be parsed against this schema.
- `undefined` — if the agent did not produce an output (for example stopped before it could produce an output)

If you are using handoffs with different output types, you should use the `Agent.create()` method instead of the `new Agent()` constructor to create your agents.

This will enable the SDK to infer the output types across all possible handoffs and provide a union type for the `finalOutput` property.

For example:

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  code={handoffFinalOutputTypes}
  title="Handoff final output types"
/>

## Inputs for the next turn

There are two ways you can access the inputs for your next turn:

- `result.history` — contains a copy of both your input and the output of the agents.
- `result.output` — contains the output of the full agent run.

In practice:

- Use `result.history` when you are manually carrying the whole conversation in your application.
- Use `result.output` when you already store the prior conversation history elsewhere and only want the new
  output items from this run.
- If you are using `conversationId` or `previousResponseId`, you usually do not pass either one
  back into `run()`. Instead, pass only the new user input and reuse the server-managed ID.

`history` is a convenient way to maintain a full history in a chat-like use case:

<Code lang="typescript" code={historyLoop} title="History loop" />

## Last agent

The `lastAgent` property contains the last agent that ran. Depending on your application, this is often useful for the next time the user inputs something. For example, if you have a frontline triage agent that hands off to a language-specific agent, you can store the last agent, and reuse it the next time the user messages the agent.

`activeAgent` is an alias for the same value.

In streaming mode it can also be useful to access the `currentAgent` property that's mapping to the current agent that is running.

## New items

The `newItems` property contains the new items generated during the run. The items are [`RunItem`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents/type-aliases/runitem)s. A run item wraps the raw item generated by the LLM. These can be used to access additionally to the output of the LLM which agent these events were associated with.

- [`RunMessageOutputItem`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents/classes/runmessageoutputitem) indicates a message from the LLM. The raw item is the message generated.
- [`RunHandoffCallItem`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents/classes/runhandoffcallitem) indicates that the LLM called the handoff tool. The raw item is the tool call item from the LLM.
- [`RunHandoffOutputItem`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents/classes/runhandoffoutputitem) indicates that a handoff occurred. The raw item is the tool response to the handoff tool call. You can also access the source/target agents from the item.
- [`RunToolCallItem`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents/classes/runtoolcallitem) indicates that the LLM invoked a tool.
- [`RunToolCallOutputItem`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents/classes/runtoolcalloutputitem) indicates that a tool was called. The raw item is the tool response. You can also access the tool output from the item.
- [`RunReasoningItem`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents/classes/runreasoningitem) indicates a reasoning item from the LLM. The raw item is the reasoning generated.
- [`RunToolApprovalItem`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents/classes/runtoolapprovalitem) indicates that the LLM requested approval for a tool call. The raw item is the tool call item from the LLM.

## State

The `state` property contains the state of the run. Most of what is attached to the `result` is derived from the `state`, but `state` is also serializable/deserializable and can be used as input for a subsequent call to `run()` if you need to [recover from an error](/openai-agents-js/guides/running-agents#exceptions) or resume a paused [human-in-the-loop](/openai-agents-js/guides/human-in-the-loop) flow.

## Interruptions

If you are using `needsApproval` in your agent, your run might pause and expose `interruptions`. This array contains the `RunToolApprovalItem`s that require a decision before the run can continue. Resolve them through `result.state.approve(...)` / `result.state.reject(...)`, then call `run()` again with that same state. Check the [human-in-the-loop guide](/openai-agents-js/guides/human-in-the-loop) for end-to-end patterns.

## Other information

### Raw responses

The `rawResponses` property contains the raw LLM responses generated by the model during the agent run.

### Last response ID

The `lastResponseId` property contains the ID of the last response generated by the model during the agent run. This is the value you pass back as `previousResponseId` on the next turn when using OpenAI Responses API chaining.

### Guardrail results

The `inputGuardrailResults` and `outputGuardrailResults` properties contain the results of the guardrails, if any. Guardrail results can sometimes contain useful information you want to log or store, so we make these available to you.

Tool guardrail results are exposed separately via `toolInputGuardrailResults` and `toolOutputGuardrailResults`.

### Usage

Token usage is aggregated in `result.state.usage`, which tracks request counts and token totals for the run. For streaming runs this data updates as responses arrive.

<Code lang="typescript" code={usageExample} title="Read usage from RunState" />

### Original input

The `input` property contains the original input you provided to the run method. In most cases you won't need this, but it's available in case you do.
